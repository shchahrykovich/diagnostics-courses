### Solution for Nancy memory leak

#### Task 1

Launch the WebApp.exe application from the [bin](bin/) folder. Run the [MakeRequests.bat](bin/MakeRequests.bat). Take 2 memory dumps a few seconds apart.

You can take memory dumps with a help of Task Manager or you can use procdump.exe from the [tools](../tools/) folder. `procdump -ma -n 2 -s 15 WebApp` this command creates 2 memory dumps of WebApp application 15 seconds apart.

#### Task 2

Open the first memory dump in WinDbg. Load SOS extension and print out managed heap statistics:
```
!loadby sos clr
!DumpHeap -stat
```
Now repeat these steps for the second dump and compare two tables.
