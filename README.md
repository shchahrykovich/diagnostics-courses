### About This Repository

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/shchahrykovich/diagnostics-courses](https://badges.gitter.im/shchahrykovich/diagnostics-courses.svg)](https://gitter.im/shchahrykovich/diagnostics-courses?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

This repository contains supporting materials for Sela's diagnostics courses. The instructor will direct you to specific labs as the course progresses. Before you start working on the labs, make sure to review the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) document. It contains information on required software installations as well as some configuration steps you should perform on your system.

### List of Labs

> Note: For each lab below, [C++] indicates it's a lab that would mostly interest C++ developers; [C#] indicates that it's a lab that would mostly interest C# developers; and [kernel] indicates that it's a lab that would mostly interest driver developers. Labs not marked with either tag can be interesting for both audiences. In any case, if you are building a managed application that has some unmanaged components, you should consider working through *all* the labs.
